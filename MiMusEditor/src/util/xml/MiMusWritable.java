/**
 * 
 * In MiMus, an object is Writable if it can be written down to
 * an XML document that conforms the annotated corpus. Classes
 * implementing MiMusWritable are, in general, model objects that
 * have specific parameters which must be expressed as an XML
 * element in the corpus. The method toXMLElement() returns this
 * XML element. The name of the root entry is returned by the
 * method getWritableName().
 * 
 * In order to write an object into an XML, another information
 * needed is where to store it, i.e. under which XML entry. The
 * method getWritableCategory() returns the name of the XML entry
 * that will be parent of the element created by toXMLElement().
 * 
 * All methods are accessed by MiMusXMLWriter, which contains the
 * functionality to write the corpus to XML files, and it's called
 * from the UI actions.
