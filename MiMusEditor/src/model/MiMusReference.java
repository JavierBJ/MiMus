/**

 * 
 * A MiMusReference is an instance of a MiMusBibEntry in a
 * certain MiMusEntry document of the corpora. It specifies what
 * bibliography entry the reference is addressed at, as well as
 * the specific pages where the reference happens for such document.
 * 
 * The conceptual relations between these classes can be summarized as:
 * 
 * 1 <MiMusEntry> has several <MiMusReference>
 * 1 <MiMusReference> has 1 <MiMusBibEntry>
 * Hence, 1 <MiMusBibEntry> is indirectly linked to several <MiMusEntry>
 * 
 * This allows for definition of information specific to the <MiMusEntry>
 * for each appearance of the same <MiMusBibEntry>.
 * 
 * Its String representation is constructed from that from its MiMusBibEntry,
 * just by attaching the pages field at the end of it.
