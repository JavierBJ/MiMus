/**
 * Relation is a relation between two Entities in the MiMus corpus.
 * There are categories of relations, each of which are specified for a
 * certain type of entities. For instance "serveix_a" is between Artista
 * and Promotor.
 * 
 * Note that Relations are actually RelationInstances, because there are
 * no Relation concepts (the types are already predefined), but just
 * appearances of these in the documents. Hence, it contains a foreign
 * key to Document.
 * 
 * In the MiMus database, Relations are implemented hierarchically, i.e.
 * with a table for the data common to all relations, and many subtables
 * with the data specific to the implementations.
