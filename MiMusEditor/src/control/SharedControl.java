 * 
 * A SharedControl object registers which MiMus UI components are
 * running. It follows a Singleton pattern that assures creation 
 * of only one object for the whole application, no matter how many 
 * components are in use.
 * 
 * The Singleton forces SharedControl to be constructed using the method
 * SharedControl.getInstance(), which provides lazy initialization.
 * 
 * By centralizing the references to these components, SharedControl
 * allows them to communicate with each other when they perform 
 * changes of state that affect others. This is achieved with an 
 * observer pattern that is defined in <EventSubject> and <EventObserver>.
